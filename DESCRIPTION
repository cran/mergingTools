Description: Implementation of two tools to merge Hardware Event Monitors (HEMs) from different subexperiments. Hardware Reading and Merging (HRM), which uses order statistics to merge; and MUlti-Correlation HEM (MUCH) which merges using a multivariate normal distribution. The reference paper for HRM is: S. Vilardell, I. Serra, R. Santalla, E. Mezzetti, J. Abella and F. J. Cazorla, "HRM: Merging Hardware Event Monitors for Improved Timing Analysis of Complex MPSoCs," in IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, vol. 39, no. 11, pp. 3662-3673, Nov. 2020, <doi:10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013051>. For MUCH: S. Vilardell, I. Serra, E. Mezzetti, J. Abella, and F. J. Cazorla. 2021. "MUCH: exploiting pairwise hardware event monitor correlations for improved timing analysis of complex MPSoCs".
